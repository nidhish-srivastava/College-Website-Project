# EduFord-Website-Project

Hello Everyone...

Created a basic college website without any use of JavaScript but the UI portion is kind off good(at my level of knowledge of CSS)
This website involves the use of HTML,CSS only.
I haven't made the links functional.



NOTE- 1.IT IS NOT RESPONSIVE
      2.The basic design is taken from a Youtube video,but then i gave this website a completely new touch
